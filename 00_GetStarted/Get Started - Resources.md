## 💎Obsidian Basics

Have a look at the [official Obsidian documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian). It describes all the features and workflows in detail starting with the basics like how to install Obsidian and create your first vault, but also more advanced things.

## 🧩 Community plugins 

Other community plugins that we find useful for our own vaults:

- [Settings Search](https://github.com/javalent/settings-search)A small but helpful plugin. It adds a search bar to your Obsidian settings which saves a lot of time clicking through the interface in search of settings.
- [Icon folder](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder): Add Icons to your folder names to recognize them more easily
- [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)Edit and create Excalidraw drawings (can also be later used for collaborative work online)
