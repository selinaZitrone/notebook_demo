# Get Started - Resources 
Here you find our suggestions for additional community plugins that we find useful. Also we link to some tutorials and online resources that were helpful for us to set up our Obsidian.
## ðŸ’ŽObsidian Basics

Have a look at the [official Obsidian documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian). It describes all the features and workflows in detail starting with the basics like how to install Obsidian and create your first vault, but also more advanced things.

For more information and inspiration on what you can do with Obsidian check out the following tutorial by Nicole van der Hoeven:

## ðŸ§© Community plugins 

Other community plugins that we find useful for our own vaults:
- [Settings Search](https://github.com/javalent/settings-search)A small but helpful plugin. It adds a search bar to your Obsidian settings which saves a lot of time clicking through the interface in search of settings.
- [Icon folder](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder): Add Icons to your folder names to recognize them more easily
- [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)Edit and create Excalidraw drawings (can also be later used for collaborative work online)
