# Get Started - Vault

Below, you can find a description of the structure and functionality of this demo vault.
## ðŸ“‚Folder structure

This vault comes with some suggested folders and workflows. However, every personal workflow is different. Therefore, this is just a suggestion to start with, not a mandatory structure. The predefined folders are:

- **01_Journal**: Folder for Labbook-style files to organise your days/weeks and keep track of tasks and activities.
	- **Daily**: If you create a daily file it will be stored here.
	- **Weekly**: If you create a weekly file it will be stored here.
- **02_Projects**: This is the place for organising and storing project files
	- **canvas**: For Canvas files (for brainstorming etc.)
	- **notes**: For project notes
- **03_Meetings**: Notes for meetings
- **04_Literature**: Here you store and manage your literature notes. 
	- **library:** A subdirectory for your literature notes that you create from your Zotero data base (see [[Literature notes from Zotero]] )
	- The `Overview` file automatically creates an overview of all the literature notes in your vault.
- **05_Zettelkasten:** Contains linked notes of your thoughts, ideas and concepts to build your knowledgebase in a Zettelkasten way.
- **Attachments**: All attachments (e.g. PDFs, figures, ...) will automatically be stored here and can be embedded in the notes. 
- **Templates**: In this folder you can find the templates which are used in the different vault workflows

> [!warning] Caution
Please note, that some of the workflows that we set up for this vault depend on the folder names not to change. If you change folder names or names of specific files (especially the templates), some workflows have to be adjusted.

## âš™Settings and community plugins

We preinstalled and configured some community plugins in this vault that are needed for the [[#ðŸ§°Workflows]] described below. 

The following community plugins are preinstalled:
- **Calendar**: Adds a little clickable calendar to your notebook. Used for
	- [[Periodic notes and lab journal]]
- **[Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)**:  Provides a JavaScript API and pipeline-based query language for filtering, sorting, and extracting data from Markdown pages. Used for
	- [[Periodic notes and lab journal]]
	- [[Project management]]
- **Emoji shortcodes**: Insert emojis in your text using the short-codes. E.g. `:purple_heart:` for ðŸ’œ or `:see_no_evil:` for ðŸ™ˆ. Used in almost all files to make them look prettier and to mark sections
- **[Periodic notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)**: Create and navigate between daily and weekly files (also monthly, quarterly or annual files are possible). Used for
	- [[Periodic notes and lab journal]]
-  **[Tasks](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/)**:  Format, label and track tasks across your entire vault. Can be used in the entire vault but is mainly used in
	- [[Periodic notes and lab journal]]

	- [[Literature notes from Zotero]]
