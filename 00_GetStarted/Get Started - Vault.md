# Get Started - Vault

Below, you find a description of the structure and functionality of this demo vault.

Please note that some files contain comments explaining what a note does. These comments by us are in *italic text*.
## 🗃 Folder structure

This vault comes with suggested folders and workflows. The demo folders are:

- 📂**01_Journal**: Labbook-style files to organise your days/weeks and keep track of tasks and activities.
	- 📂**Daily**: If you create a daily file it will be stored here.
	- 📂**Weekly**: If you create a weekly file it will be stored here.
- 📂**02_Projects**: This is the place for organising and storing project files
	- 📂**canvas**: For Canvas files (for brainstorming etc.)
	- 📂**notes**: For project notes
- 📂**03_Meetings**: Meeting notes
- 📂**04_Literature**: Here you store and manage your literature notes. 
	- 📂**library:** literature notes created from Zotero (see [[Literature notes from Zotero]] )
	- 🗒The [[Overview]] file automatically creates an overview of all literature notes
- 📂**05_Zettelkasten:** Contains linked notes of your thoughts, ideas and concepts to build your knowledgebase in a Zettelkasten way.
	- 🗒The [[00_Overview]] file creates an automatic overview of all the notes in your Zettelkasten
- 📂**Attachments**: All attachments (e.g. PDFs, figures, ...) will automatically be stored here and can be embedded in the notes. 
- 📂**Templates**: Contains templates which are used in the different vault workflows

We know that every workflow is different. Therefore, this structure is just a suggestion to start with, not a mandatory structure. You can change the folders at any time but note that some workflows need to be adjusted.

> [!warning] Caution when changing folder structure
Please note, that some of the workflows set up for this vault depend on the folder names not to change. If you change folder names or names of specific files (especially the templates), some workflows have to be adjusted. Have a look at the individual workflow files for more info

## ⚙Settings and community plugins

We installed and configured some community plugins in this vault that are needed for the [[#🧰Workflows]] described below. 

The following community plugins are installed:
- **Calendar**: Adds a little clickable calendar to your notebook. Used for
	- [[Periodic notes and lab journal]]
- **Emoji shortcodes**: Insert emojis in your text using the short-codes. E.g. `:purple_heart:` for 💜 or `:see_no_evil:` for 🙈. Used in almost all files to make them look prettier and to mark sections
- **[Periodic notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)**: Create and navigate between daily and weekly files (also monthly, quarterly or annual files are possible). Used for
	- [[Periodic notes and lab journal]]
-  **[Tasks](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/)**:  Format, label and track tasks across your entire vault. Can be used in the entire vault but is mainly used in
	- [[Periodic notes and lab journal]]
- **[Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/)**: The Templater plugin is used to create the templates for all workflows.
- **[Zotero integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration)**: Connect your Zotero library with Obsidian and create literature notes, citations and bibliographies. Used in
	- [[Literature notes from Zotero]]

Of course there are many other cool community plugins. Check out [[Get Started - Resources#🧩 Community plugins]] for some suggestions.
