# 🧠Knowledge management with *Zettelkasten*
*Plugins used:* Templater

The *[Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)* is a tool for personal knowledge management that is based on the idea of small, atomic pieces of information or concepts stored in separate notes that are linked with one another. Obsidian is perfect for implementing such a method to create a sustainable knowledge base. Here, we describe how to use the basic Zettelkasten system as it is implemented in this vault. Below you can find links that describe the method and different ways of implementing it in Obsidian in more detail.

All single *Zettel* notes go into the `05_Zettelkasten/` folder and there is one [[00_Overview]] note that automatically lists all Zettel notes. You can already find an example Zettelkasten in this folder. It's probably easiest to understand the method, if you look through the example. You can check out the graph view of this Zettelkasten to see how the notes are connected (see [[Get Started - Obsidian#The graph view]]).
## Add a new Zettel
Right click on the Zettelkasten folder and say **New note**. The new Zettel note is automatically created using the [[zettel template]] and it is opened for you. On top you can give the note a meaningful title.
## Link Zettels
Zettel notes can and should be linked via 2 concepts: file links and tags.
In every Zettel, you have a callout box on top for "Related topic". Here you can link other Zettels that are related to the current topic. Additionally, you can add tags (either in the front matter or by using the #tag notation) for common topics.
## Add references
Every Zettel has a reference section on the bottom. Here you can put a list of all the references you used to write this Zettel. You can e.g. link a literature note or an external resource.
