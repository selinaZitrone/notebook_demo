> [!Abstract]-
>  
> Ecological models are important for environmental decision support because they allow the consequences of alternative policies and management scenarios to be explored. However, current modeling practice is unsatisfactory. A literature review shows that the elements of good modeling practice have long been identified but are widely ignored. The reasons for this might include lack of involvement of decision makers, lack of incentives for modelers to follow good practice, and the use of inconsistent terminologies. As a strategy for the future, we propose a standard format for documenting models and their analyses: transparent and comprehensive ecological modeling (TRACE) documentation. This standard format will disclose all parts of the modeling process to scrutiny and make modeling itself more efficient and coherent. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecological models are developed for different purposes: exploration of ideas and theories, demonstration of concepts, understanding of general principles and patterns, predictions of ecosystem behaviors, and many more [15,16].

The format of TRACE documentations follows the sequence of tasks in the modeling cycle (Figure 2). Accordingly, this format can also be used for modeling notebooks; [(p. 483)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M9D5QSED?page=483&annotation=4PISFUYT)
